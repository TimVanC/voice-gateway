# 🐛 Bug Fixes from Live Testing (October 14, 2025)

## Issues Found During Testing

Based on your live test call, we identified and fixed **4 critical issues**:

---

## 🔴 Issue #1: Name Field Accepted Gibberish

**Problem:**
- User spoke gibberish for name field
- System accepted it without validation and moved on
- No confidence check triggered

**Root Cause:**
- Field context inference didn't recognize "What's your full name?" as a name question
- Only looked for "first name" or "last name" specifically

**Fix Applied:**
```javascript
// Added to inferFieldContext()
if (lowerQuestion.includes('full name') || lowerQuestion.includes('your name')) 
  return 'first_name';
```

**Also Added:**
- Detection for common non-name words: "no", "yes", "okay", "thanks", "bye", "uh", "um"
- Confidence penalty of -0.7 for these words in name fields
- Minimum length validation (< 2 chars = low confidence)

---

## 🔴 Issue #2: Too Impatient on Phone Number

**Problem:**
- System asked for phone number
- Gave up immediately saying "okay fine don't give me one"
- User didn't have time to respond

**Root Cause:**
- VAD silence threshold too short (500ms)
- System detected "silence" too quickly and moved on

**Fix Applied:**
```javascript
// Increased from 25 to 40 frames
const SILENCE_FRAMES_REQUIRED = 40;  // ~800ms (was 500ms)
```

**Additional Safety:**
- Added `MAX_SPEECH_FRAMES = 500` (~10 seconds) to prevent runaway buffering
- Added `speechFrameCount` tracking for better debugging
- Enhanced logging: now shows total speech duration in logs

---

## 🔴 Issue #3: Wrong Context Inference

**Problem:**
- User said "Bye. See you later. Bye."
- System interpreted it as email context
- Should have recognized it as a goodbye/dismissal

**Root Cause:**
- No detection for farewell phrases
- System tried to process every utterance as data

**Fix Applied:**
```javascript
// Added farewell phrase detection
const farewellPhrases = ['bye', 'goodbye', 'see you', 'thanks for your time', 
                         'have a good day', 'no thanks'];
if (farewellPhrases.some(phrase => text.toLowerCase().includes(phrase))) {
  confidence -= 0.6;  // Very low confidence for goodbye phrases
  indicators.push('farewell_phrase');
}
```

**Impact:**
- Confidence drops to ~0.40 for farewell phrases
- Triggers verification or rejection instead of acceptance

---

## 🔴 Issue #4: No Response After Spelling Prompt

**Problem:**
- System asked "Do you mind spelling out that email for me?"
- User started spelling
- System gave no response (hung/dead air)

**Root Cause:**
- Verification prompt wasn't added to OpenAI's conversation history
- OpenAI didn't know it was in "verification mode"
- System was waiting but OpenAI wasn't listening

**Fix Applied:**
```javascript
// NOW: Add to conversation history BEFORE speaking
if (openaiWs && openaiWs.readyState === WebSocket.OPEN) {
  openaiWs.send(JSON.stringify({
    type: "conversation.item.create",
    item: {
      type: "message",
      role: "assistant",
      content: [{ type: "text", text: captureResult.prompt }]
    }
  }));
}

// THEN: Speak it
setTimeout(() => {
  speakWithElevenLabs(captureResult.prompt);
}, 200);
```

**Impact:**
- OpenAI now knows verification prompt was spoken
- System can properly process verification responses
- No more dead air after prompts

## 🧪 Testing Recommendations

Please re-test with these scenarios:

### Test 1: Name Validation
```
System: "What's your full name?"
You: "Blah blah" or "No" or "Thanks"
Expected: System should ask "Could you please spell your first name for me?"
```

### Test 2: Patient Phone Number Collection
```
System: "What's the best number to reach you?"
You: [Wait 1-2 seconds, then speak phone number]
Expected: System should wait patiently, NOT say "okay fine don't give me one"
```

### Test 3: Farewell Detection
```
System: "What's your email?"
You: "Bye, thanks for your time"
Expected: System should detect low confidence and ask for clarification OR gracefully end call
```

### Test 4: Verification Response
```
System: "Do you mind spelling out that email for me?"
You: "j-o-h-n-@-e-x-a-m-p-l-e-.-c-o-m"
Expected: System should respond immediately with "Got it, thanks!" or similar
```

## 📊 Expected Behavior Changes

### Before (Broken):
```
❌ Accepts gibberish names
❌ Gives up on responses in 500ms
❌ Interprets "bye" as data
❌ No response after verification prompts
```

### After (Fixed):
```
✅ Validates name fields for common non-names
✅ Waits 800ms before giving up
✅ Detects farewell phrases with low confidence
✅ Properly handles verification flow
```

## 🔧 Configuration Parameters

You can further tune these in the server files:

### VAD Timing (if users need even more time):
```javascript
const SILENCE_FRAMES_REQUIRED = 40;  // Current: 800ms
// Increase to 50 for 1 second
// Increase to 60 for 1.2 seconds
```

### Confidence Threshold (if too strict/lenient):
```javascript
const CONFIDENCE_THRESHOLD = 0.60;  // Current: 60%
// Lower to 0.50 for more lenient
// Raise to 0.70 for stricter
```

### Silence Detection Sensitivity:
```javascript
const SILENCE_THRESHOLD = 0.01;  // Current RMS threshold
// Lower to 0.005 for more sensitive (detects quieter speech)
// Raise to 0.02 for less sensitive (only loud speech)
```

## 💡 Key Learnings

1. **Field Context Inference**: Need to check for multiple phrasings ("full name", "your name", "first name")
2. **VAD Timing**: Phone conversations need longer pauses (800ms+) vs. in-person (500ms)
3. **Farewell Detection**: Important to recognize when user is ending conversation vs. providing data
4. **Conversation History**: OpenAI needs verification prompts in history to maintain context

---

## 🎯 Next Steps

1. **Re-test all scenarios** listed above
2. **Monitor new logs** for timing and context inference
3. **Adjust thresholds** if needed based on your call patterns
4. **Test edge cases**: Fast talkers, slow talkers, background noise
5. **Validate full conversation flow** from greeting to closing

**Status:** ✅ **FIXES DEPLOYED - READY FOR RE-TESTING**

**GitHub:** https://github.com/TimVanC/voice-gateway  
**Latest Commit:** `cf8fb3c`  
**Date:** October 14, 2025

The system should now:
- ✅ Properly validate name fields
- ✅ Wait patiently for user responses
- ✅ Detect farewell phrases correctly
- ✅ Respond after verification prompts

**Please restart your server and test again!** 🚀
